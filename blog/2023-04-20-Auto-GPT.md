Auto-GPT源码： https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT

体验可以使用第三方产品，免费在线体验： https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/

也可以自己在本地体验。本篇都是介绍如何在本地体验以及一个本地测试例子，例子选取的太简单了，好像没有发挥好Auto-GPT的优势。只是为了跑通流程，体验下Auto-GPT。

## 安装

安装非常简单，只需要需要以下几个步骤：
1. [安装python3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)
2. [安装git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. 代码仓库拉取到本地 `git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT`
4. 进入项目目录，执行 `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. 复制项目中的`.env.template`，命名为`.env`，并修改其中的3个参数`OPENAI_API_KEY` `PINECONE_API_KEY` `PINECONE_ENV`，改成自己的。若没有，可去对应[ChatGPT官网](https://chat.openai.com/)和[Pinecone官网](https://www.pinecone.io/)注册下，后台管理界面获取。
6. 运行Auto-GPT `python -m autogpt --gpt3only`

## 例子

### Auto-GPT运行日志

问Auto-GPT一个问题，`娃在幼儿园被老师批评了，作为家长应如何应对。`。在和Auto-GPT的交互中。要交互的是`AI Name:`随便写写，`Describe your AI's role:`随便写写，关键是目标，最多可以有5个，这里就写了一个`Goal 1: write an article about : children are commented by the Kindergarten teacher, how to enlighten the children`

```txt
PS C:\Users\hanwei\Documents\Github\Auto-GPT> python -m autogpt --gpt3only
GPT3.5 Only Mode:  ENABLED
Welcome to Auto-GPT!  Enter the name of your AI and its role below. Entering nothing will load defaults.
Name your AI:  For example, 'Entrepreneur-GPT'
AI Name: writer
writer here!  I am at your service.
Describe your AI's role:  For example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'
writer is: who can write an article
Enter up to 5 goals for your AI:  For example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'
Enter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.
Goal 1: write an article about : children are commented by the Kindergarten teacher, how to enlighten the children
```

通过下面的日志，可以看到每个具体的命令以及Auto-GPT的处理过程。比ChatGPT多了网上的搜索过程，网上搜索信息，阅读提取要点，整理新的文章。整个过程是自动化的，只需要输入一个目标，Auto-GPT就会自动完成和AI的多次交互，以目标为导向（最多可以给Auto-GPT设定5个目标），并自我prompt，自主完成任务。

Kindergarten children were commented by teachers, how to console them?

ChatGPT:
If a kindergarten child is commented by a teacher, the parents can comfort and encourage the child by listening to their feelings, encouraging them to express themselves, and affirming their efforts. Moreover, parents can also talk to the teacher about the specific reasons for the comment and work with them to help the child improve in areas that need development. In addition, parents can provide positive feedback and reinforcement for the child's achievements to boost their self-esteem and confidence.

> 可见ChatGPT回答的也不差，对问题的处理，方方面面，多角度都考虑到了，语言简洁。Auto-GPT则生成了一大段文章。实际上是将很多文章拼接和总结要点组成成的结果。也可以改下提示词让ChatGPT就此话题写一篇文章，看看结果如何。

让ChatGPT以此为话题生成一篇文章：

人类：
Kindergarten children were commented by teachers, how to console them? write an article about it

ChatGPT：
As parents, it can be tough to see our little ones feeling upset or hurt by something that has been said to them, especially when it comes from someone they should be able to trust and look up to - like a teacher. This is why learning how to console them is so important.

If your child has been commented on by their teacher, the first thing to do is listen to their feelings. Ask them how it made them feel, and really listen to their response. Reassure them that you understand their feelings, and let them know that it's okay to feel upset or frustrated about the situation.

Letting your child express themselves is another important part of consoling them. Encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings about what has happened with you, and let them know that their thoughts and feelings are valid. This will help your child feel heard and understood, which can go a long way in helping them process what has happened.

It's important to affirm your child's efforts, as well. Let them know that you are proud of them for trying their best, and that their efforts are appreciated. This can help to build their confidence and self-esteem, and can make them feel more secure in their abilities.

In addition to consoling your child, it may also be helpful to speak with their teacher about the situation. Ask the teacher for feedback on how your child has been doing in class, and ask what specific areas they may need help with. Work together with the teacher to create a plan for how to help your child improve in areas that need development.

Finally, it's important to remember that every child is unique and may require different strategies to help them cope with comments from their teacher. However, by using these strategies, parents can help enlighten the child and improve their overall well-being. By listening, affirming, and encouraging them, parents can help their child process their emotions and move toward a positive resolution.

**以下是上面ChatGPT回答的翻译结果：**

作为家长，当我们看到孩子因为被某人（如老师）说了一些伤害性的话而感到不安或受伤时，会感到很困难。因此，学习如何安慰他们非常重要。

如果您的孩子受到老师的评论，首先要做的是听取他们的感受。询问他们感觉如何，并认真聆听他们的回答。向他们保证了解他们的感受，并让他们知道感到不安或沮丧是没关系的。

让孩子表达自己的想法和感受也是安慰他们的重要方法之一。鼓励他们与您分享对所发生事情的想法和感受，并让他们知道他们的想法和感受是有价值的。这将帮助孩子感到被听到和理解，从而更好地处理所发生的事情。

肯定孩子的努力也很重要。让他们知道你为他们尽力而为感到骄傲，并且感激他们的努力。这有助于提高孩子的自信心和自尊心，并使他们对自己的能力更加自信。

除了安慰孩子之外，与老师交谈也可能会有所帮助。询问老师对孩子的表现有何反馈，并询问是否需要帮助。与老师共同制定帮助孩子在需要发展的领域取得进步的计划。

最后，重要的是要记住，每个孩子都是独特的，可能需要不同的策略来帮助他们应对老师的评论。然而，通过使用这些策略，父母可以帮助孩子处理情绪，并向积极的结果迈进。通过聆听、肯定和鼓励他们，家长可以帮助孩子处理情绪，走向积极的解决方法。
